	"Place":"Alappuzha",
	"Description":"This laid-back market town Alappuzha, previously known as Alleppy, is built on canals that form a web, which serves the coir industry. All around are coconut palms, and obviously, coir making, boat building, toddy tapping and fish farming are mainstays of the village economy. Every August, Alappuzha comes to life with an adrenaline-pumping event that sees huge, low slung chundan vellams (snake boats), rowed by up to 100 people, compete for the Nehru Cup. Alappuzha's attraction does not, however, lie solely in its natural aspects. Apaprt from the Poomkavu Church, other well-known religious sites in and around Alappuzha are Mullackal Raja Rajeshwari Temple, Mannarasala Temple and Salafi Juma Masjid Mosque.",
