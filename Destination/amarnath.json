	"Description":"Located in one of the worldâ€™s most incredible landscapes of Lidder Valley in Kashmir, the  cave shrine of Shri Amarnath is situated at an altitude of 3680 mts. Flanked by breathtaking snow-clad capped peaks, this Shiva shrine provides a wonderful opportunity to soak in the sacred energies of the Himalayas.Each year in the month of Shravan (July-August) when the moon is full, thousands of yatris, as pilgrims are called, congregate here to worship a naturally formed ice Lingam, symbol of Lord Shiva. The waxing and waning of the Lingam with the moon has remained a world marvel. According to popular belief it reaches the maximum height on the puranmashi (full moon) of Shravan which is the main day for Darshan.",
